# ETH-Activity-FE

## Description :open_book:

An Ethereum visualizer to allow users to see the different trends that appear on the platform. Many new users struggle with the adoption of Ethereum, and it could be caused by the lack of visibility to see how other users interact with Ethereum. ETH-Activity attempts to solve this problem by giving visualizations on the current trends of Ethereum to allow new users spend their Ethereum on a platform that they trust.
